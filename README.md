#Fire Simulation

## Summary

Each "Fire Particle" is just a circle sprite that changes color and size and gains an upward force based on its temperature. The bottom of the screen is the heat source. Particles also transfer heat to each other when they touch. Particles also emit a glow as they get hot and the intensity of the glow is proportional to the particle's temperature.

## Overview

This is a real time simulation of a fire using Unity's [Physics Engine](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PhysicsEngine.html).
